title: About Me
---

My name is Kyle Burris and I am the Assistant Director of Baseball Research and Development in the Cleveland Guardians front office.  In 2019, I completed my PhD from the department of Statistical Science at Duke University, advised by Dr. Peter Hoff.  I'm an avid sports fan who is passionate about statistics education, data science, and Bayesian statistics.     

This site serves as my personal webpage where I will link to the webpages of courses that I am teaching/have taught and papers that I have published.
