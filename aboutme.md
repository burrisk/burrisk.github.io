title: About Me
---

My name is Kyle Burris and I recently completed my PhD from the department of Statistical Science at Duke University, advised by Dr. Peter Hoff.  I'm an avid sports fan who is passionate about statistics education, data science, and Bayesian statistics.  I currently work in the front office of the Cleveland Indians.    

This site serves as my personal webpage where I will link to the webpages of courses that I am teaching/have taught and papers that I have published.

If you are interested in knowing more about me or have comments about what you see here, feel free to [send me an email!](mailto:kyle.burris@duke.edu)
